Submitted by: Tebibu Kebede

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Summary

Search Book is an android app that you can search anything with and gives you an answer

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: Heart emoji, fire emoji, animal emoji

## Application Features


The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [ *] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate
  - Be sure to add the screenshot to "Chosen Screenshot" below.
- [* ] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [* ] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout
- [* ] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView
- [ *] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [* ] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [* ] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [* ] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
- [* ] Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea



## Chosen Screenshot

I have chosen to duplicate the following layout from the Facebook app:

It is for an app that you can search anything and it gives you the answer
